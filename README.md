# Tetris

## Introduction

This project is a re-creation of [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris), a classic video game. I submitted
this project as my term project for CPSC 210 (Software Construction) at UBC.

## GIFs of the Application

Here are a few GIFs demonstrating the features of the program.

Some gameplay is shown in the following GIF:

The game over screen allows players to add and remove their scores to and from a scoreboard, as well as to save and view their
scores. Some of this functionality is shown below.

Finally, the clip below shows a very fast game where I started on Level 19. Note that players can set the starting
level of the game themselves, as shown in the clip.
